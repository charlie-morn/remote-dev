# Initial Setup:

1. If you're using docker and vscode for development, please use the vscode extension remote-development along with any of your other favorites.  
2. The one thing you have to install locally (well... not technically, but I recommend playing around with it) is poetry. Just run `pip install poetry` to get the latest version of this very cool package management tool / build tool. More to come on cool features here in future sessions!
3. Once poetry is installed, follow the setup here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial and get into your container. The Dockerfile will install all the necessary dependencies. If you're not using docker, I'd recommend setting up a virtual environment (see here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), activating your virtual environment, and then running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of the project.

We will be going through the guide here: https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/tutorials/getting_started/tutorial_overview/

Feel free to get started before the lunch and learn!
